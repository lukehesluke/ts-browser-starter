# ts-with-prettier-starter-projects

A small collection of fairly minimal TypeScript starter projects that include Prettier.

Each starter project is contained within a git branch.

These include:

- [`nodejs`](../../tree/nodejs) - to create an application for Node.js.
- [`browser`](../../tree/browser) - to create an application for the browser.
- [`browser-with-react`](../../tree/browser-with-react) - to create an application for the browser using React with `.tsx` files.
