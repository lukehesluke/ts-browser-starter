# ts-browser-starter

Fairly minimal browser TypeScript starter project. It contains:

- NVM is set to node LTS (at time of writing)
- TSConfig includes strict mode and is otherwise fairly standard
- ESLint with standard settings
- Prettier with standard settings and set to be used by VSCode for formatting
- Webpack and SWC for building TypeScript files -> JavaScript
  - It uses content hashing so that changes can be seen when refreshing the page in a caching browser
- html-webpack-plugin is used to build a minimal HTML page which calls the built JavaScript files

That's it. Bye ü¶ß
